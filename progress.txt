First steps with Laravel following the documentation's bootcamp.

For this first commit, I've learned:

1. To create a new Laravel project with Composer by running the command composer create-project laravel/laravel project_name.
2. To start the local server with Artisan by running php artisan serve.
2.1. Artisan is the Laravel's CLI which provides a bunch of helpful commands like running the local server, creating migrates, generate files and so on.
3. To use Laravel Breeze which provides authentication features to use on the application.
4. To return views with Blade templates.
5. To use the command php artisan make:model -mrc model_name to create a Model, a Migration and a Controller for a resource.
6. To create and use Eloquent Models.
6.1. Eloquent is the ORM included in Laravel.
6.2. Models are PHP classes used to interact with the database. Each class represents a table in the database.
7. To create and run Migrations.
7.1. Migrations are anonymous PHP classes where we can create and modify to our schemas.
7.2. To run the migrations using php artisan migrate command.
8. To create a Controller which is the class responsible for HTTP requests and responses (we can return a Blade view directly).
9. To create and implement routes for a resource's controller. The routes are located on the web.php file.
10. To create relationship between classes.
11. To use Artisan Tinker to run PHP code. It was used to retrieve data from the database. i.e. App\Model\Chirp::all();
12. To retrieve and display data.
13. To implement the layouts with HTML and Tailwind CSS and use the conditional statements like @if @endinf, @foreach @endforeach.
14. To add authorization to execute some action like update and delete data.
